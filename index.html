                  <p>McKenna is a junior studying Marketing and this is her third year singing alto in Power Chord. This year, she is also serving as the group’s president! McKenna loves PC because it gives her an opportunity to forget about the stress of school or anything else for a couple of hours and just make music with her friends. Outside of the group, McKenna, like Bri, is an active member of Kappa Alpha Theta and she has three pet cats (one of which her parents replaced her with when she left for college). Lastly, McKenna and Tasnia were roommates during their freshman year, which is a running joke that the two of them never let the rest of the group forget.</p>

This year, she is serving as the group’s Social Media Manager and Marketing Coordinator! Tasnia is an active member of the engineering sorority, Phi Sigma Rho, and she works as a College of Engineering Ambassador.

                  <p>Natalie is a senior studying Food Science and Technology with a focus in Fermentation (she brews her own hard cider at home!). She also has minors in Chemistry and German, and even got to study abroad for a few months in Germany! This is her fourth and final year in the group singing as both an alto and a tenor, depending on the song. Natalie’s favorite part of the group is the fact that it is always changing, so she gets to meet and know so many new people. Natalie has seen the group grow and served as President, Treasurer and Secretary in the past, and Secretary again this year. Natalie is a sweetheart with a rich, smooth voice that always takes our breath away. We will definitely miss her next year, but she is from Corvallis so we know we’ll see her again soon!</p>

                  <p>Nicole is a freshman from Burbank, California studying Vocal Performance. This is her first year singing as an alto in Power Chord. She loves being a part of the group because of its energy and everyone’s collective sense of humor. Aside from PC, Nicole also sings as a part of Bella Voce, the all female choir here at OSU. Nicole is very calm, cool and collected, but energetic and fun at the same time. Her gorgeous voice and amazing personality are what make her such an incredible part of our group!</p>

                  <p>Zach is a sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering. This is his second year in the group and he sings bass. Zach is most easily identified as the “really tall guy” in Power Chord because he towers over all of us. Zach’s favorite thing about PC is how fun it is when we are all together making music. In his spare time, he likes to code and hang out with friends! Zach has a great sense of humor and is so fun to be around.</p>

                  <p>Alex is a junior studying Choral Music Education and this is her second full year in PC singing as an alto. This year, she is even serving as the group’s Music Director, which is arguably one of the most challenging and rewarding positions available! As music director, Alex gets to explore different teaching techniques to create fun and productive rehearsals, and that is one of her favorite parts of being involved in Power Chord. She was also a member of LBCC’s all female a cappella group, The Sirens, and is now a part of OSU’s Chamber Choir. Alex would kill for avocados and we know that she would kill for PC too!</p>

Luis is kind, extroverted, social and always brings happiness to the group with his humor and positive energy. He always knows how to have a good time and be a great musician at the same time.

                  <p>Michael is a freshman studying Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Music Education (instrumental). This is his first year singing as a bass in Power Chord. He loves being a part of PC because of the sense of community and company that the group brings. A fun fact about Michael is that he is one of those people who occasionally listens to Christmas music all year long. We love Michael because he is quiet and quite the enigma, but has an incredible sense of humor and adds so much value and talent to the group!</p>
